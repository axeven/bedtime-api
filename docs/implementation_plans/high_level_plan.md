# High-Level Implementation Plan - Bedtime API (Progress Tracker)

## Overview
This document outlines the high-level implementation plan for the Bedtime API using Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. Each phase focuses on a single, testable deliverable that builds incrementally toward the complete system.

## Overall Project Progress
- [x] **Phase 1**: Foundation & Basic User Management ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Phase 2**: Sleep Record Core Functionality ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Phase 3**: Social Following System ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Phase 4**: Social Sleep Data Access ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Performance & Scalability Features ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] **Phase 6**: API Refinement & Production Readiness ⬜ Not Started

**Overall Completion**: 4/6 phases (67%)

## Implementation Strategy
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, implement to pass tests, refactor
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase produces a working, testable feature
- **Vertical Slicing**: Complete end-to-end functionality per phase
- **Database-First**: Establish data foundation early
- **API-Centric**: Focus on RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP semantics
